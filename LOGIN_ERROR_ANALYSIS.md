# Login Failed - Server Error Detected

## 🔴 Issue Found:

**Error Response:**
```json
{"success":false,"message":"Server error during login"}
```

**Status:** This is a server-side error, not user error!

---

## 🔍 What Happened:

1. ✅ **Health Check:** SUCCESS
2. ✅ **Register:** SUCCESS (Status 201)
3. ❌ **Login:** FAILED (Server error)

**This means:**
- App is running
- Database connection OK
- User created successfully
- **Login function has a bug!**

---

## 🐛 Possible Causes:

### 1. Password Hashing Mismatch
**Issue:** Password comparison failing in login
**Location:** `routes/auth.js` line ~130

### 2. Database Query Error
**Issue:** SELECT query failing
**Location:** `routes/auth.js` login endpoint

### 3. JWT Token Generation Error
**Issue:** Token signing failing
**Location:** After password verification

## 🔧 Quick Fix Needed:

### Check Railway Logs:
1. Railway Dashboard
2. Service "web"
3. Tab "Logs"
4. Look for error near timestamp: 2025-10-16T19:02:xx

**Expected error format:**
```
Login error: Error: ...
    at /app/routes/auth.js:131:20
```

---

## 🚀 Temporary Workaround:

**Use the registration token directly:**

The register response contains a valid token:
```json
{"success":true,"token":"eyJhbGci..."}
```

You can use this token to access the app without login!
